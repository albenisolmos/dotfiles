# dotfiles
These are my config files for these programs:
* vim
* ranger
* zsh
* tmux

## Installation
For install all the config files just download the repo and run `make install` inside the folder. Alternatively you can install a certain file with `make {file}`. The process of installation will only link the files to their specific path (Ex. ~/ or ~/.config)
